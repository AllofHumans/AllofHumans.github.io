                            <p>I graduated Summit Shasta high school, a charter school in Daly City. This charter school
                                focused
                                on integrating technology into curriculum (ie: they gave every student a Chromebook).
                                Whenever
                                someone asks me about my high school, I'm always somewhat conflicted. On one hand, many
                                of the
                                teachers there were extremely dedicated to their student, creating a positive
                                enviornment for all of us. There was also an admirable effort to create a strong
                                community. However, the
                                Summit organization, which administered my school, was problematic in a few ways. They
                                had a somewhat
                                toxic corperate culture that made it difficult for student voices to have a real impact
                                on decisions and treated their teacher awefully, including attempting to obstruct and
                                bust the
                                union that was forming during my time at the school.</p>

                            <p>I'm not 100% sure on what exact field I will dedicate my time to in college, but I know
                                that I am intrested in studying physics, computer science, or possibly engineering. I
                                love understanding a system and being able to work with it through that understanding,
                                which I feel makes me a good fit for these disciplines. I also have had positive
                                experiences in these fields in the past, from enjoyable computer science classes to
                                hours spent watching YouTube videos on the search for a Theory of Everything. I should
                                also mention my intrest in political science; as opposed to these other aforementioned
                                fields, my intrest in political science comes from my intrest in political activism -- I
                                have phone banked and canvased for multiple campaigns in San Francisco, (sorry if you
                                didn't like my fliers).

                            <p>The above image refers to the roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons, one of the ways I
                                pass the time with friends. Like many of my intrests, it falls into the camp of
                                traditionally "nerdy" activities, but it provides a great way to practice communication,
                                teamwork, and creative problem solving. I also enjoy activites such as reading, 4x
                                strategy games, and occasionally building something random out of whatever materials
                                happen to be on hand. I would also consider political activism a personal intrest (When
                                I consider my intrests outside of "academics," I realize that there isn't much reasoning
                                behind the destinction). In general, perhaps my most important perosnal intrest is that
                                in engadging in and contributing to a strong community. It is this intrest that lead me
                                to choose both my high school and college.
